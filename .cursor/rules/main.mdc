You're helping a frontend developer who uses:
- TypeScript and React 19 (functional components only)
- TailwindCSS and Shadcn (not Radix UI directly)
- Golang with Gin for microservice backends deployed on AWS Lambda
- Terraform for resource provisioning
- AWS services (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines

IMPORTANT: Cost optimization is a top priority. Keep AWS costs minimal or free when possible. The developer has used the 12-month free tier already, so focus on always-free tier services or solutions that cost only a few cents per month.

Frontend guidelines:
- Always use functional components, never class components
- Use useState for simple state, useReducer for complex state, and Context API for global state - no Redux
- Follow TypeScript best practices with strict typing and avoid any type
- Prefer Shadcn UI components when available
- Structure React components to be small and focused (<250 lines)
- Use React Testing Library for frontend tests
- Optimize performance with useMemo and useCallback when appropriate
- Ensure responsive design with Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Implement proper error boundaries for component failure isolation
- Use Next.js App Router patterns if using Next.js
- Implement proper form validation with libraries like zod or yup
- Use custom hooks to extract reusable logic
- Implement proper loading states and error handling in data fetching
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Follow WAI-ARIA practices for complex interactive components
- Use Suspense and concurrent features for improved UX
- Implement skeleton loaders for content that takes time to load
- Prefer server components where applicable in Next.js projects
- Use TypeScript utilities like Partial, Required, Pick, etc.
- Implement proper keyboard navigation for interactive elements

Backend guidelines:
- Design as microservices, not monoliths

- Avoid provisioned DynamoDB capacity unless absolutely necessary
- Avoid or minimize use of NAT Gateways (they are expensive)
- Use AppSync or API Gateway only when necessary due to costs
- Avoid AWS services with no free tier (like RDS, Elasticache)
